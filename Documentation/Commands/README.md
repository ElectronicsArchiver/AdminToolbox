# Commands

*How to use **AdminToolbox** commands* <br>
*both in the server & remote console.*

<br>

## Requirements

**AdminToolbox** uses **[SMod]** which requires the <br>
following to allow for the use of commands:

- Enable `enable_ra_server_commands` in `config_gameplay.txt`

- Whitelist your **SteamId** / **Server Role**

<br>
<br>


>Any `Player` variable can be switched out with `*` to target all players. Not specifying a bool toggles it.
>Using `(command) list` will list all players with the currently enabled status. (Like godmode for example)

> Player input doesn't need the full name, it will grab the closest matching name containing your entry
